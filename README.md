# Integrating Deep Learning for Scene Understanding in Hypoxia and High-Altitude Physiological Analysis

Scene understanding in high-altitude and hypoxic environments is pivotal for advancing our comprehension of physiological and pathological responses to extreme conditions. Traditional research often focuses on isolated physiological metrics or localized environmental data, limiting the integrative understanding of complex interactions in such environments.

This repository introduces a novel framework that addresses these limitations by combining a **Dynamic Scene Graph Transformer (DSGT)** with a **Context-Aware Learning Strategy (CALS)**. Together, these methods enable robust multi-modal scene understanding in extreme conditions, offering new insights into the interplay between environmental and physiological factors.

## Features

### Dynamic Scene Graph Transformer (DSGT)
- **Hierarchical Representations:** Captures temporal and spatial variations in dynamic scenes.
- **Graph-Based Attention Mechanisms:** Models multi-scale dependencies and global contextual insights.
- **Dynamic Adaptation:** Adjusts to environmental changes for improved scene understanding.

### Context-Aware Learning Strategy (CALS)
- **Hierarchical Supervision:** Improves model accuracy through structured guidance.
- **Domain-Specific Priors:** Leverages knowledge about high-altitude and hypoxic environments.
- **Adaptive Curriculum Learning:** Ensures robust generalization across diverse and dynamic scenarios.

### Key Benefits
- Superior accuracy in **multi-modal scene understanding**.
- Enhanced **temporal dynamics and object relationship modeling**.
- Insights into the interaction between **environmental and physiological factors**.
